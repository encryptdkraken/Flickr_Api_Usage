Hello Everybody,

This is project is to perform an asynchronous call to a web server to pull resources from it.

Asynchronous: Asynchronous calls do not block (or wait) for the API call to return from the server. Execution continues on in your program, and when the call returns from the server, a "callback" function is executed.



Ajax is A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object that can pull data requested from web servers via an applicatioin key, in this case we are calling from the Flickr api.


How to use
Simply type in what you want to search a picture for and the page shall load the first 20 images of that call from Flickrs public api.
