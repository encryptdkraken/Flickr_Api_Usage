Hello Everybody,

This is project is to perform an asynchronous call to a web server to pull resources from it.

Asynchronous: Asynchronous calls do not block (or wait) for the API call to return from the server. Execution continues on in your program, and when the call returns from the server, a "callback" function is executed.



Ajax is A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object tbephat can pull data requested from web servers via an applicatioin key, in this case we are calling from the Flickr api.


//How to use

Simply type in what you want to search a picture for and the page shall load the first 20 images of that call from Flickrs public api.
